\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{Computer Science is about writing algorithms using data structures.
In the latter field, the focus is on
processing information in a systematic and often automatized way. One goal in the
design of solution methods (algorithms) is about making efficient use of hardware
resources such as computing time and memory. It is true that hardware development
is very fast; the processors? speed increases rapidly. Furthermore, memory has
become cheap. One could therefore ask why it is still necessary to study how these
resources can be used efficiently. The answer is simple: Despite this rapid development,
computer speed and memory are still limited. Due to the fact that the increase
in available data is even more rapid than the hardware development and for some
complex applications, we need to make efficient use of the resources.}
